## 0. Import a simple function from a simple file

Imports the function ´def add(a, b):´ from the file 'add_0.py' and prints the result of the addition ´1 + 2 = 3'
- You have to use ´print´ function with string format to display integers
- You have to assign:
	- the value ´1´ to a variable called ´a´
	- the value ´2´ to a variable called ´b´
	- and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions ´add´ and ´print´
